# OneOr0

I'm an IT Specialist and Machine Learning Enthusiast currently working as a Security Analyst in the Blue Teaming field. My passion lies in networks, IT security, and coding, which I approach with careful planning, methodical execution, and deep passion. As a dedicated autodidact, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and continually expanding my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning.
While I work full-time in IT security, I’m also eager to take on new opportunities as a freelance developer. Let’s build something great together!
